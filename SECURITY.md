# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I plan on updating this but its a bat script  

What it does is it looks for itself then stores the data value for its location 

Then it finds the vrc root and plants 3 files   

CheckMV.txt contains nothing and is only there to help verify that the copy of files are complete 

Sp0 and sp1 start the vrchat instances with their respective profile state  

This is about as far as i am and I may create updates and post them in a seperate directory on this project 

If this is the case, security updates will appear here. Yet there is nothing I can say at the moment about this 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Currently I have no knowledge of vulnerabilities in this script.
