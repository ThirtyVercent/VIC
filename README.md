IT IS THERE TO MAKE SURE THE EAC INSTANCES DON'T OVERLAP


IF SKIPPED, THE EAC INSTANCE WILL COME BACK WITH ERROR 30005 COULD NOT WRITE FILE 32 or WON'T START AT ALL!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	THIS DOES NOT ALTER YOUR VRChat SHORTCUT ON THE DESKTOP
	TO RUN MULTIPLE INSTANCES USE STARTVRC.bat
	YOU CAN RENAME AND MOVE DEFAULTSTART.bat/NONDEFAULTSTART.bat ANYWHERE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	This is to open 2 vrc instances

	It does not bypass eac just uses a loophole that allows 2 accounts to be loaded on the same instance

	Locate your install directory for vrc. If you have not changed it don't worry about looking for it

	There is a default that this script will search in

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you did change the directory of install to another drive or just somewhere else
	This is how you find it


		Start steam

		Go to library

		Find vrchat

		Click the gear icon that will be to the right of the screen on the same plane as the play button

		Click properties on the drop down 

		This will open another window

		Click local files on the left side in this window

		Select browse (its on the top right of the window)

		And copy the address at the top on the file explorer

			It should look similar to this 
			D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\VRChat

			It may have a different drive letter but the base should start with SteamLibrary
			If it doesn't it should not matter as long as the end is VRChat

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep the directory open

Run VRCIC.cmd

Wait for it to load

On the option screen type 2 for yes

Paste the path and press enter and follow the steps
